                <h2>Discussion</h2>
                <p>Everyone in the home should have a say in when, where and how smart home technology is used.</p>
                <p>Before you purchase any device, add an automation or log, or install any new feature, always try to explore the potential risks and harms with your family members and others who visit frequently. Sit down with them and create some norms and values around how the devices should, and should not, be used.</p>
            
                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><input type="checkbox"/> WHY would the device be useful in the first place?</li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox"/> SHORT TERM. What are potential short term downsides? Sensors might reveal more types of behaviour than intened. For example, keeping a log of when lights are switched means you're keeping a log of when people come and go, and how long they sleep. Air quality sensors can reveal how many people are in a room, or what they are doing.</li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox"/> LONG TERM. Could the change contribute to a culture of surveillance? Could it harm a sense of autonomy?</li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox"/> TEMPTATION. How might the existence of a device or data log lead to temptation to use its data against the other people in the household?</li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox"/> WHO is allowed to control the device?</li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox"/> WHEN is it ok? For example, are there parts of the day when data logging could be disabled? Practically, think twice before creating automations that can turn on the lights at night, as this could disturb others.</li>

                        <li><input type="checkbox"/> DATA LOGGING. If data from the device is logged, for how long should this be done? How much detail do you need from a sensor? Do you need minute to minute updates, or might hourly updates be sufficient? Always try to collect as little data as possible.</li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox"/> DISABLING. Make sure people feel that turning off a device's data recording features is acceptable and normal.</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
            
                <h3>Children and teenagers</h3>
                <p>Children and teenagers need privacy to support their mental and social development.</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sensors in children's room could pick their sleeping habits. While it's great if kids go to bed on time, sometimes being naughty is healthy and fun.</li>
                        <li>Sensor could pick up when people have sex. For example, a humidity or carbon dioxide sensor can indicate increased physical activity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Generally, ask if children are behaving a certain way based on intrinsic motivation - because they want to - and not because they feel surveillance and controlled. </p>
            
                <h3>Partners</h2>
                <p>Even if technology is implemented with the best of intentions, it can turn into a form of subtle control later. For example, keeping track of when your partner is home can become a source of unnecessary miscommunication and distrust. Once the data is there, is can be too tempting to look at it, and use it as 'ammunition' in discussions.</p>
                <p>Smart homes technology has also been used in domestic violence situations. While it's impossible to avoid such abuse through technological counter measures, we're tried to implement some experimental mitigation systems in Candle. It's one of the reasons why it's possible to stop recording data for a while.</p>    
                
                <h3>Guests</h3>
                <p>It goes without saying that guests should be informed about the existence of smart home technology.</p>
                <p>You may be tempted to keep track of the working hours of house cleaners. Be aware that not disclosing such practices beforehand is illegal.</p>

            <div id="extension-welcome-page-things">
                <h2>Adding new things</h2>
                <p>There are a number of ways you can add new 'things'.</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Purchase new devices</li>
                        <li>Install new addons that create 'virtual things'</li>    
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Purchasing devices</h3>
                <p>We recommend you purchase Zigbee devices. We especially recommend devices by IKEA. Not only because Candle (through the Zigbee2MQTT addon) can update firmware for most IKEA devices, but also because IKEA has shown to care about privacy in the design of their systems. A full list of supported Zigbee devices can be found on the <a href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/" target="_blank">Zigbee2MQTT website</a>, while a list of recommended devices can be found on the <a href="https:/www.candlesmarthome.com" target="_blank">Candle website</a>. Going with the recommended devices will give you the best experience, as they have been tested to work well.</p>
                <p>If you're curious, you can also try to create DIY devices that are documented on the Candle website. These devices are as transparent about their data practices as they can get, as you are literally putting them together yourself.</p>
                <p>Avoid WiFi devices. While some addons allow you to connect to such devices, they come with too many downsides. For one, they can autonomously connect to the internet, which can lead to unwanted data transfers. If you must use WiFi devices, then connect them via the Candle Hotspot addon. This addon creates a separate 'guest network', and will allow you some control over which servers these devices connect to.</p>
                <p>If should go without saying that you should avoid using devices from parties such as Google or Amazon for whom large scale data collection is part of their business model.</p>
                
                <h3>Virtual devices</h3>
                <p>Virtual things are quite common. For example, the Energy Use addon calculates the total energy use as reported by real energy monitoring devices, and creates a new 'virtual thing' that shows the total energy use of those devices.</li>
                    
                <h3>Things inbox</h3>
                <p><img src="/images/add.svg" style="float:left; margin:1rem; width:3rem"/>Getting the things to show up in the things overview starts by going to the thing overview and clicking on the big plus button in the bottom right. This will take you to the "things inbox", where you can accept newly available things.</p>
                <p>
                    <img class="extension-welcome-screenshot" src="/extensions/welcome/images/things_inbox.png" alt="An example of the things inbox" />
                    <span class="extension-welcome-image-description">An example of the things inbox</span>
                </p>
                <p>At the things inbox page you can also give your new thing a name. If you use voice control, then make sure the name is easy to pronounce.</p>
                <p>Things have "properties". For example, a lightbulb has a "state" (on or off) and a "brightness". Usually one of the properties can be highlighted on the things overview. You can select which one using the dropdown.</p>
                <p>If you select "custom property", then you can upload a custom icon for your thing. Have a look at www.publicdomainvectors.com if you want to download some icons.</p>
                 
                <p><img src="/images/overflow.svg" style="float:left; margin:1rem; width:3rem"/>You can always change all this later by going to a thing's page, and then clicking on the edit button in the bottom right.</p>
                
                <h3>Groups</h3>
                <p>You may have also noticed that the things inbox allows you create new "groups". Groups become very useful once you have multiple devices. Try making a group called "Living room", and then go back to the things overview page. You'll notice the group name there. Try dragging on of your things into this new group.</p>
                <p><img src="/extensions/welcome/images/drag_into_group.gif" alt="Dragging an icon into a group" style="margin:1rem auto;max-width:50%;display:inherit;" /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
                <p>At some point you may have a lot of things, at which time the search functionality becomes more useful. On the things overview just start typing (part of) the name of a thing. Press escape at any time to cancel the search. If your search has only one thing remaining, then you can press enter to open the thing details page. Once there you can press backspace to go back to the things overview.</p>

            <div id="extension-welcome-page-logs">
                <h2>Data logs</h2>
                <p>Data logs are powerful, so let's talk about precautions first.</p>
                <p>Once you have a device, you can create a data log for it. Always make sure you only log data if everyone is OK with logging the data, and discuss for how long the data should be kept. Having these logs can lead to unexpected forms of abuse. Resist the temptation by making sure there isn't much data to abuse.</p>
                <p>If you are going to log data, always make sure you also have the Privacy Manager addon installed so that data can easily be deleted or modified.</p>
                
                <h3>Adding a new log</h3>
                <p><img src="/images/add.svg" style="float:left; margin:1rem; width:3rem"/>Visit the logs page, and press the button in the bottom right to start adding a new log. </p>
                <p>Select the device you want to record data from, and then the property you want to record. Also select how long data may be stored. Choose the smallest duration necessary for your pruposes.</p>
                
                <h3>Deleting data</h3>
                <p><img src="/images/overflow.svg" style="float:left; margin:1rem; width:3rem"/>You can delete a log by clicking on its name on the logs overview page. This will take you to a page that shows only that single log. There you can click on the edit button, and delete it.</p>
                <p>You can also use the Privacy Manager to delete data. It offers a higher level of control, even allowing you to delete individual data points, or all the data before or after a certain moment in time.</p>
                
            </div>
        
        
            <div id="extension-welcome-page-rules">
                <h2>Automations</h2>
                <p>Once you have a number of things, you can start to make them respond to certain events. For example, you could turn on the lights in the morning, and turn them off at night automatically.</p>
                
                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>Rules offer a lot of possiblities. You could make things react to button presses, the time of day, the value of certain things, and more.</p>
                <p>
                    <img class="extension-welcome-screenshot" src="/extensions/welcome/images/creating_a_rule.gif" alt="Creating a rule animation" />
                    <span class="extension-welcome-image-description">Creating a rule to turn on a light at a certain time</span>
                </p>
                <p>When creating a new rule, you can place the 'inputs' on the left, and the things want to change in response on the right. For example, you could turn on a light at 10:50.</p>
                <p>Once a rule is valid, a sentence describing it will be shown at the top of the screen. If you look at it closely, then you might spot a little dropdown option inside of it:</p>
                <p><span class="triangle-select-container">
                    <select class="triangle-select rule-effect-select" style="width: 1.8rem;">
                        <option selected="">If</option>
                        <option>While</option>
                    </select>
                </span></p>
                <p>Selecting the "if" option makes it a momentary rule. This means it triggers once when the conditions are right, and then goes to sleep again. For example, a window contact sensor could turn of the heater as soon as someone opens the window. But while the window is open, you could simply turn on the heater anyway.</p>
                <p>If you select the "while" option, the rule will check every second. In the example of the window and the heater, this means you cannot turn the heater on while the window is open, because every second the rule will try to switch off the heater again. </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="extension-welcome-screenshot" src="/extensions/welcome/images/rule_and_or.gif" alt="Creating a more complex rule animation" />
                    <span class="extension-welcome-image-description">If it's 10:50 AND/OR the laptop is on the network, then turn on the light.</span>
                </p>
                <p>If you add multiple 'inputs', then you gain another choice:</p>
                
                <p><span class="triangle-select-container">
                    <select class="triangle-select rule-trigger-select">
                        <option>and</option>
                        <option selected="">or</option>
                    </select>
                </span></p>
                <p> Do all the triggers on the left have to be true, or only one of them? For example, you could make the heater turn on when the temperature dips below 18 degrees, but only if at that moment your phone is present on your network. This way the heater only turns on if the temperature drops AND you're home.</p>
                
                
                
                <h3>Followers</h3>
                <p>You can make the property of one device change in relation to another. For example, if the brightness of one light changes, you could make the brightness of a second light follow that brightness value automatically.</p>
                <p>It's also possible to invert this relation: while one light grows brighter, another could grow dimmer. You can also play with these levels. For example, 0 to 50% of volume of the radio could translate to values between 0 and 100 for a light. If the radio volume is set above 50%, the light will stay at 100%, since it can't go any higher.</p>
                
                <H3>Some recommendations:</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use an IKEA Symfonisk sound controller with the Internet radio addon. Using Rules, let a press of the button turn the radio on and off. Using Followers, let the rotation of the button change the volume of the radio.</li>
                        <li>Use an IKEA push button with the Privacy Manager addon. Let a button press delete the last 2 hours from your data logs. Then place the button in a place where every member of the household can press it without drawing attention to themselves.</li>
                        <li>Using the Network Presence Detection addon, automatically turn of the heating if none of the phones or laptops are on your wifi network. Similarly, disable voice control when nobody is home to avoid abuse by criminals shouting through the letterbox.</li>
                        <li>Switch off electric heaters if someone opens a window or outside door.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
                <p>This becomes more useful once you have a lot of things. When you're creating a rule you can use your keyboard to filter which things are available. Press escape to cancel the search at any time, and see all your things again.</p>
            </div>
        
        
            <div id="extension-welcome-page-voice">
                <h2>Voice control</h2>
                <p>Using your voice to control your home is a little bit like magic. Candle doesn't come with voice control pre-installed, but if you want to try it you will need three things:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A speaker</li>
                        <li>A supported USB microphone</li>
                        <li>The Voco addon</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Voco can be found in the Candle app store. We developed Voco with support from the (EU funded) Sherpa project (www.project-sherpa.eu), and the code is open source (www.github.com/createcandle/voco). Voco in turn relies on Snips, a piece of software which handles the actual voice recognition. This software does not connect to the internet either.</p>
                <p>The great thing about using a USB microphone is that you can unplug it at any time. While Voco never sends anything to the internet, we wanted to offer the feeling of security that comes with being able to be absolute sure that there is no microphone. To be clear: the Raspberry Pi (which the controller runs on) does not have a built-in microphone.</p>
                <p>Tip: don't put the microphone too close to the speakers, otherwise Voco might have trouble picking up your voice while music is playing.</p>

                <p>The app store tries to inform you of what 'addons' are available, and how those addons may affect privacy and security. It provides the following pieces of information:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A privacy rating. This rating is created by Candle. The ideal is for an addon to have 5 closed eyes, which indicates that the addon only stores data locally, and follows 'privacy by design' principles.</li>
                        <li>The community can also share their review of the addon. These are shown as the star rating. More stars mean the addons is liked and works well. If you create an account, then you can also share your opinion.</li>
                        <li>The more glasses icons an addon has, the more it requires technical knowldge to set up.</li>
                        <li>Our opinion. Where possible we try to clarify what addons to. This opinion is not created by the developer of the addon, but by the Candle team.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                <p>Candle is built 'on top of' the Webthings Gateway, an open source project originally developed by Mozilla, the makers of Firefox. The addons you find in the app store are created by volunteers, and are open source. That makes them wonderfully transparent. It also means they may contain bugs, or create instabilities. They may also send data to cloud services (simply because the feature is offers requires it).</p>
                <p>We cannot guarantee that non-Candle addons will work well with the addons we developed. Similarly, these addons currently do not come with privacy policies. Even if an addon has good reviews, any update could change how the addon functions.</p>

                <h2>Using a display</h2>
                <p>So you connected a (touch) screen. Very nice. What you're seeing is essentially the Chromium browser (the stripped down open source version of Chrome) running in "kiosk mode".</p>
                <p>There are some things you might find interesing:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Drag your finger down from the top of the screen to the middle of the screen to refresh the page.</li>
                        <li>Dragging your finger from the left of the screen to the middle is like pressing the back button on your browser.</li>
                        <li>Kiosk mode comes with a virtual keyboard. It should pop-up automatically when you click on an input field. If you don't need this keyboard you can disable it in the Candle theme settings.</li>
                        <li>You cannot open links to other websites inside this "kiosk mode".</li>
                        <li>You cannot open files from the hard drive inside this "kiosk mode". If you want to upload photos to the photo frame, you will have to do this from another device, such as your phone or PC.</li>
                        <li>Some addons might also behave slightly differently. For example, the page you're reading right now is only visible if you're using an attached display.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            
            
            <div id="extension-welcome-page-grid">
                <h2>Going off the grid</h2>
                <p>We like the idea of using Candle without any internet connection. It's a statement: without an internet connection you can still have most smart home funtionality. It's the only way to guarantee that no data is sent to any internet server. As a welcome side-effect, it also makes it more difficult for hackers to attack the controller.</p>
                <p>If you'd like to try this, you'll currently need to do three things:</p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Setup Candle to your liking while it still has internet access. Download updates, install any addons you want to use, and maybe update the firmware of your Zigbee devices.</li>
                        <li>Connect Candle to a router without internet access. We hope to eliminate this step at some point, but for now: buy a small wifi router, and connect Candle to this instead. While Candle currently needs to connect to a wifi hotspot to function, that wifi hotspot doesn't need to be connected to the internet.</li>
                        <li>Set the time. If the router doesn't have internet access, neither will Candle. This does mean that whenever it reboots it cannot contact Internet Time Servers to ask what time it is. You will have to use the Power Settings addon and set the time manually after each reboot of the controller.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>In the future we may support plugging a "DS3231 real time clock module" into your Raspberry Pi. This will give it its own clock with its own backup battery, so step 3 might be eliminated.</p>
                <p>Similarly, it might be possible to eliminate step 2. You can already use the Hotspot addon to have the controller generate its own little WiFi network, and connect to that to gain access to the controller. Unfortunately the controller currently will not start up without a connection to a router.</p>

                <h2>Privacy</h2>
                <p>Candle is designed to be a showcase for new privacy features. We experiment with new ideas, and would love to hear your feedback and suggestions for further improvement. We focus on two situations:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Corporate surveillance</li>
                        <li>Coveillance</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Corporate surveillance</h3>
                <p>This one is simple. The only way to be sure that your private information is not misused is to make sure it never leaves your home. Candle explores to what degree this can be done without sacrificing ease of use.</p>
                <p>Some examples:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Where possible, the devices that Candle recommends will not autonomously connect to the internet. Zigbee devices, for example, cannot connect to the internet directly, They only connect to a central controller in your home, and that central controller can then request data from the internet if need be. For example, IKEA devices ask the controller to check for updates every 15 seconds. We helped develop code in the Zigbee management software that Candle uses (zigbee2MQTT) that make it possible to ignore these requests, or limit how often update checks are done. By default the Zigbee2MQTT addon limits it to only once every 2 days.</li>
                        <li>Almost all "smart" devices that can connect to the internet directly (and your computer does this too) connect to "internet time servers" when they are turned on. These servers then provide the current time. Not having a clock on board saves a little money, but it means that these time servers are notified whenever you start your device. Whenever you connect to a server you by definitiion have to share your IP adres, which is personally identifiable information. That's why the Power settings addon allows to you disable this and set the time manually. The Hotspot addon can intercept these time requests from Wifi devices, and provide them with the time from the controller instead. While time servers are not nefarious, being able to avoid this is an example of how fundamentalist we are about protecting any data leakage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Coveillance</h3>
                <p>There are increasing reports that people living in smart homes are tempted to use the system to spy on each other. For example, partners may check eachothers coming and going. They may check the behaviour of their children. This can create a culture of surveillance within the home, which can be detrimental to human flourishing. While more technology is clearly not the answer to tech abuse, we do explore how these issues can be mitigated.</p>
                <p>Some examples:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We try to add a 'data collection' toggle to devices managed by addons. This allows you to stop collecting/receiving data from devices whenever you want, and even create scedules and rules for this.</li>
                        <li>The network presence detection addon has a data-mute option for each device. This does the same thing as disabling data collection, but it comes with a timer. Every time someone clicks it, the period of time that incoming data is ignored is extended by one hour. The idea is that anyone can click this button at any time.</li>
                        <li>The privacy manager addon offers many ways in which data can be deleted. This ranges from "delete all data collected in the last 8 hours for every device" to "change one datapoint for a specific device". We hope this adds some uncertainty to how reliable the logs are, so that they are less likely to be used as 'evidence' in domestic disagreements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Privacy policy</h3>
                <p>While Candle tries to minimize data leaving the controller, there are some practical limitations:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you open the Updates or Shop tab of the Candle App Store, then the controller will download the latest list of all available addons. We do not collect any data about you here, although technically there will be some information about your visit in the server logs, which are outside of out control. This also means that the controller doesn't periodically connect to the Candle server to check for updates for you. You'll have to check for updates yourself once in while.</li>
                        <li>On the advanced options page of the Zigbee2MQTT addon you can choose to download a newer version of Zigbee2MQTT (www.zigbee2mqtt.io). If you decide to do this, then a newer version will be downloaded from www.github.com, a website run by Microsoft. If you own IKEA Zigbee devices, the addon will also check with the IKEA server if there are firmware updates. As always: any connection to an internet server automatically means you are sharing your IP address with it (otherwise it wouldn't know where to send data back to).</li>
                        <li>By default Candle connect to Internet Time Servers to get the latest time. The Raspberry Pi (the little computer Candle runs on) does not have its own clock and backup battery, so after a reboot it needs to know what time it is. You could manually provide this time.</li>
                        <li>If you use the Web Interface addon, then encrypted data from your smart home may be sent to the Candle webserver. We've designed this in such a way that these messages do not contain any personally identifiable information. Think of the Candle server as a blindfolded person passing sealed envelopes between two people.</li>
                        <li>Specific apps may connect to internet servers. For example, the Internet Radio addon streams audio from the internet. It also connect to >www.radio-browser.info if you open the search page, and downloads data from that (community run) website if you do a search.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>By the way, the reason this page doesn't offer links to the website it mentions is that your browser might try to "pre-load" those website. Websites do this to make it seem like they offer a really fast browsing experience, but this also means they contact all those servers, even if you don't actually decide to visit them.</p>
